# Zingo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

## Development server

First, make sure you have already downloaded and setup the mock JSON server, [Zingo-Server](https://github.com/r3hensler/zingo-server). Start the Zingo-Server by running `npm start`. The Zingo-Server will listen on port 3000.

Next, run `npm start` for a dev server. A browser window should open to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Istanbul code coverage results will be written to the /coverage folder, under the project root.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). You will need to also be running the [Zingo-Server](https://github.com/r3hensler/zingo-server) in order to successfully execute the E2E tests.
